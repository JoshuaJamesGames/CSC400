/*
 * Imagine an array of n items from which you can choose. 
 * You will place the items you choose into a knapsack of size k. 
 * Each item has a size and a value. Of course, you cannot take more items 
 * than you have space for in the knapsack. Your goal is to maximize the 
 * total value of the items you take.
 * 
 * Design a recursive algorithm maxKnapsack to solve this knapsack problem. 
 * The parameters to the algorithm are the knapsack, the array of items, and 
 * the position within the array of the next item to consider. 
 * 
 * The algorithm chooses the items for the knapsack and returns a knapsack 
 * containing the chosen items. A knapsack can report its size, its contents, 
 * the value of its contents, and the size of its contents.
 * 
 * Write the classes Knapsack and KnapsackItem . Then write a program that 
 * defines the method maxKnapsack . 
 * 
 * The program should read the size of the knapsack and then the 
 * size, value, and name of each available item.
